For this project I will be using data from the Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML), which is part of the Earth System Research Laboratories project. The Laboratory is one of the most important research facilities currently in existence, as it is responsible for the collection and analysis of important data about the atmosphere, climate, and the ocean. The Global Monitoring Laboratory offers a number of benefits to the scientific community, including access to a vast array of data, the ability to conduct research on a global scale, and the ability to share research results with other scientists around the world. As part of its research, the GML provides data on the atmospheric content of four prominent greenhouse gasses, carbon dioxide (CO~2~), methane (CH~4~), nitrous oxide (N~2~O), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF~6~).\n\nThe links to the data sets can be found on the [Trends](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/) section of the GML website. The data sets are also linked as text files below:\n\n[Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~)](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt)\n\n[Methane (CH~4~)](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/ch4/ch4_mm_gl.txt)\n\n[Nitrous Oxide (N~2~O)](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/n2o/n2o_mm_gl.txt)\n\n[Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF~6~)](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/sf6/sf6_mm_gl.txt)\n\n### Air and Sea Surface Temperatures from NCEI at NOAA\n\nAir temperature and sea surface temperature (SST) are critical indicators of global climate change, as they reflect the Earth's energy balance and play a significant role in regulating the planet's climate system. Both air and sea surface temperatures have direct and indirect impacts on various aspects of the environment, including weather patterns, ocean currents, and ecosystems.Air temperature refers to the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere, usually measured at a standard height of 2 meters above the ground. It is a key factor in understanding global weather patterns, climate change, and the heat balance of the Earth. On the other hand, sea surface temperature is the temperature of the ocean's surface layer, which influences the exchange of heat and moisture between the ocean and the atmosphere. Variations in SST can lead to significant changes in weather patterns, precipitation, and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.\n\nGlobal mean temperature is a crucial metric for comparing greenhouse gas concentrations with temperature changes. It is the average temperature of the Earth's surface, combining air temperature over land and sea surface temperature. This metric allows scientists to monitor global warming trends, understand the relationship between greenhouse gas concentrations and temperature, and evaluate the effectiveness of climate change mitigation efforts.\n\nOne reliable source for air and sea surface temperature data is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA NCEI). They provide comprehensive datasets on climate and weather, including air temperature and sea surface temperature records from stations around the world. The datasets are updated regularly, and the data can be accessed through the Climate Data Online (CDO) search system on the NOAA NCEI website. Additionally, global mean temperature data is available from several sources, such as the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and the Hadley Centre's Climatic Research Unit (CRU).\n\n## Data Exploration\n\n### Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): [Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets)\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is a critical tool in the fight against climate change. The program provides a comprehensive overview of emissions data from across the country, helping to inform policy decisions and identify areas that need additional attention. The data collected helps the EPA track trends in emissions levels and can be used to inform strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. With the help of this program, the EPA is able to create an effective response to the ever-changing environmental conditions and ensure a sustainable future for the planet.\n\nThe data can be accessed at the [Data Sets](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets) section of the GHGRP website.They are stored in a zip file containing data over the last decade. The most interesting data set from the EPA is the record of large polluters. I think it could be very interesting to use this to gauge how station proximity to large emitters effects the amplitude of seasonal cycles.\n",
