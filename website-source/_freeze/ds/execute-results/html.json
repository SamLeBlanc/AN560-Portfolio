Due to its size and scope, NOAA includes atmospheric monitoring in many of its departments. For this project I will be using data from the Global Monitoring Laboratory (GML), which is part of the Earth System Research Laboratories project. The Laboratory is one of the most important research facilities currently in existence, as it is responsible for the collection and analysis of important data about the atmosphere, climate, and the ocean. The Global Monitoring Laboratory offers a number of benefits to the scientific community, including access to a vast array of data, the ability to conduct research on a global scale, and the ability to share research results with other scientists around the world. As part of its research, the GML provides data on the atmospheric content of four prominent greenhouse gasses, carbon dioxide (CO~2~), methane (CH~4~), nitrous oxide (N~2~O), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF~6~).\n\nThe links to the data sets can be found on the [Trends](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/) section of the GML website. The data sets are also linked as text files below:\n\n[Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~)](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_mlo.txt)\n\n[Methane (CH~4~)](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/ch4/ch4_mm_gl.txt)\n\n[Nitrous Oxide (N~2~O)](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/n2o/n2o_mm_gl.txt)\n\n[Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF~6~)](https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/sf6/sf6_mm_gl.txt)\n\n### Air and Sea Surface Temperatures from NOAA's NCEI\n\nAir temperature and sea surface temperature (SST) are critical when it comes to understanding global climate change. They are interconnected to Earth's energy balance and are major factors that impact things like weather patterns, ocean currents, and ecosystems. Air temperature measures the temperature of Earth's atmosphere, taken about 2 meters above the ground. It helps us understand global weather patterns, climate change, and how Earth's heat is balanced. Sea surface temperature, on the other hand, is all about the temperature of the ocean's surface layer, and it affects the exchange of heat and moisture between the ocean and the atmosphere. Small changes in SST can lead to big shifts in weather patterns, rainfall, and even how intense extreme weather events can be.\n\nGlobal mean temperature is a another way to compare greenhouse gas concentrations with temperature changes. It's basically the Earth's average surface temperature, combining air temperature over land and sea surface temperature. This helps scientists keep an eye on global warming trends, figure out how greenhouse gas concentrations and temperature are connected, and see if climate change mitigation efforts are working.\n\nOne reliable source for air and sea surface temperature data is NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA NCEI). They offer mountains of data on climate and weather, including air temperature and sea surface temperature records from stations all around the world. The data is updated regularly and can be accessed through the Climate Data Online (CDO) search system on NOAA NCEI's website. Plus, global mean temperature data is available from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) and the Hadley Center's Climatic Research Unit (CRU).\n\n## Data Exploration\n\n### Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): [Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets)\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is important in the battle against climate change. It gives us a complete picture of emissions data from all over the country, helping to guide policy decisions and find areas that need more focus. The data helps the EPA keep track of emissions trends and can be used to come up with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With this program, the EPA can keep adapting to changing environmental conditions and working towards a sustainable future for our planet.\n\nThe data can be accessed at the [Data Sets](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets) section of the GHGRP website.They are stored in a zip file with the data from the last decade. The most interesting data set (to me) is the record of large polluters. I think it could be very interesting to use this to gauge how station proximity to large emitters effects the amplitude of seasonal cycles.\n",
