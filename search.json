    "text": "For this section, we will be using an ARIMA model to forecast future atmospheric concentrations of sulfur hexaflouride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plots show the ACF and PACF for the Sulfur Hexafluoride concentration time series. As expected, the ACF plot shows a very high degree of correlation between values, indicating that this series is not stationary. This follows the previous hypothesis that the series was not stationary due to the strong trend and weak seasonality. Since the series is not stationary, there are several options available to make it so. One of these options is differencing, where the values are recaluclated by subtracting each from the previous, providing the difference between each pair of values. Other methods include smoothing the data with a moving average or using a Box-Cox transformation to bring the data into a more stationary state. Ultimately, the goal of these transformations is to make the data stationary so that it can be better modeled and better predictions can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots demonstrate the first-order differencing of the time series. After eliminating most of the trend component, the seasonality is much more visible in the ACF plot. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of the bars in the differenced graph is much smaller than that of the initial ACF plot. A closer analysis of the ACF plot reveals that the seasonality remains relatively strong even after one differencing.The seasonal spikes appear every 12, 24 and 36 months, which is the expected result for a monthly series. Even though there is still an obvious pattern in the ACF plot, it is necessary to differentiate the series once again to make it stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter taking the difference for the second time, the plots are showing much stronger indications that the series is now stationary. Through it is not perfect, the ACF plot has much less correlation across the range of lag parameters. Although there are still some spikes at 12 and 24 months, taking another difference would not be unreasonable. However, it is important to note that if we over difference the data, it will be much more difficult to detect the signal that we are aiming for. This is evident when we look at the 3rd order difference, where the plot is almost indistinguishable from white noise. As a result, it is critical to be mindful of the order of difference when analyzing time series data.\nThe Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF) is a powerful tool for testing for stationarity in a time series. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, the ADF test should be run on the undifferenced, 1st order, and 2nd order difference of the time series. By doing so, we can compare the results and gain a clearer understanding of stationarity. The results of the ADF test are displayed below.\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration\nDickey-Fuller = -1.0021, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.9371\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration %>% diff()\nDickey-Fuller = -9.9963, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration %>% diff() %>% diff()\nDickey-Fuller = -10.064, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe results of the ADF test indicate that both the 1st and 2nd order differences are stationary, while the undifferenced series is not. This matches my hypothesis, with the exception of the first order difference. Inspection of this ACF plot reveals a clear pattern of correlation at 12 and 24 months. I find it quite puzzling that the ADF test believes that this series is stationary despite the spikes in the ACF plot.\n\n\n\nBased on the PACF and ACF plots, I will be modeling the twice-differenced \\(SF_6\\) concentration because I want to ensure that our series is stationary. Based on the ACF and PACF plots of the twice differenced \\(SF_6\\) concentration shown above, I will select 1 and 3 as possible choices for \\(p\\) and 1,2,3, and 4 as possible choices for \\(q\\). Since this data is twice differenced, I will be using a \\(q\\) value of 2.\nAfter running the model, we get the following table of AIC and BIC values based on the model parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\nd\nq\nAIC\nBIC\nAICc\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n0\n-1926.281\n-1922.574\n-1926.268\n\n\n0\n2\n1\n-1972.627\n-1965.213\n-1972.587\n\n\n0\n2\n2\n-2017.168\n-2006.047\n-2017.087\n\n\n0\n2\n3\n-2024.154\n-2009.325\n-2024.019\n\n\n2\n2\n0\n-1943.242\n-1932.120\n-1943.161\n\n\n2\n2\n1\n-2021.723\n-2006.894\n-2021.588\n\n\n2\n2\n2\n-2042.100\n-2023.564\n-2041.896\n\n\n2\n2\n3\n-2026.081\n-2003.839\n-2025.796\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the table, the model with the lowest AIC and BIC scores is the 2,2,2 model. None of the other models are that close to this one in terms of AIC and BIC scores. For the sake of comparison, I will select the worst model of the bunch (0,2,0) to show that even this is very similar to our best model. All of the option here would be adequate for forecasting this series.\n\n\n\nFor a (2,2,2) ARIMA model, the equation is:\n\\[y(t) = c + Ï(1)*y(t-1) + Ï(2)*y(t-2) - Î¸(1)*Îµ(t-1) - Î¸(2)*Îµ(t-2) + Îµ(t)\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(y(t)\\) is the value of the time series at time t\n\\(c\\) is a constant term (i.e., the mean of the series)\n\\(Ï(1)\\) and \\(Ï(2)\\) are the autoregressive coefficients for lags 1 and 2, respectively\n\\(Î¸(1)\\) and \\(Î¸(2)\\) are the moving average coefficients for lags 1 and 2, respectively\n\\(Îµ(t)\\) is white noise (i.e., a random error term) with mean zero and constant variance\n\nNow, lets consider the model diagnostics using standardized residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the most part, the residuals plots looks as we would expect. The residuals have a constant mean and variance, and the lagged p-values for the Ljung-Box statistic are under the 0.05 threshold for all except two of the lags. Something that does still appear is a spike in ACF residuals at lags 12 and 24. This would suggest that the series may not have been adequately stationary prior ro modeling. However, we mentioned this earlier, and it wsa determined that twice-differenced was the proper metric to use, as three-times differences would over difference the data and lose valuable insights.\nNext, we can plot the raw data, our chosen model (2,2,2), and the second model (0,2,0) on the same plot to see how they compare on the training data. As expected, both models are nearly identical to the SF6 data. The lines are directly on top of each other and it is impossible to make out any difference between the models and the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we can compare our ARIMA(2,2,2) model to the auto-arima model. Thankfully, the auto-arima function provides the same model as the one we came to through traditional means. This is validating because there were many choices for p,d, and q, so it is nice to know that the best model was selected in both methods.\n\n\nSeries: SF6_Concentration \nARIMA(2,2,2) \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ar2      ma1     ma2\n      1.2422  -0.5007  -1.8154  0.8326\ns.e.  0.0653   0.0550   0.0495  0.0499\n\nsigma^2 = 6.44e-05:  log likelihood = 1026.05\nAIC=-2042.1   AICc=-2041.9   BIC=-2023.56\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can use the ARIMA model to forecast the SF6 concentration over the next 10 years (120 months). The plot below shows the forecast of the ARIMA(2,2,2) model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the effectiveness of our model, we need to compare to other benchmark methods. Based on the graphs and accuracy tests below, it is clear that the ARIMA(2,2,2) model far outperforms any of the benchmark methods. Thus, we can be confident when using this model going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npred1=forecast(fit1, h=120);\naccuracy(pred1)\n\n                       ME       RMSE         MAE       MPE       MAPE\nTraining set 0.0007896781 0.00794485 0.006303769 0.0115696 0.09585017\n                   MASE        ACF1\nTraining set 0.02238707 -0.04714439\n\n\n\nf1 <- meanf(SF6_Concentration, h=120)\naccuracy(f1)\n\n                       ME     RMSE     MAE       MPE    MAPE     MASE     ACF1\nTraining set 1.282536e-16 2.071243 1.79491 -9.131477 27.7452 6.374407 0.990158\n\n\n\nf2 <- naive(SF6_Concentration, h=120)\naccuracy(f2)\n\n                     ME       RMSE        MAE       MPE     MAPE       MASE\nTraining set 0.02344371 0.02547561 0.02350993 0.3366936 0.338216 0.08349269\n                  ACF1\nTraining set 0.5054292\n\n\n\nf3 <- rwf(SF6_Concentration, h=120)\naccuracy(f3)\n\n                     ME       RMSE        MAE       MPE     MAPE       MASE\nTraining set 0.02344371 0.02547561 0.02350993 0.3366936 0.338216 0.08349269\n                  ACF1\nTraining set 0.5054292"

    "text": "SARIMA: CO2 Concentration\nIn this section, we will use a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast future atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. As the graph below illustrates, the CO2 concentration, though representing a global mean, exhibits a strong seasonal pattern. Therefore, we will employ a SARIMA model for our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCO2 Concentration (No differencing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plots display the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) for the CO2 concentration time series.

This aligns with our previous assumption that the series is non-stationary due to its pronounced seasonality. To achieve stationarity, we will apply differencing.\n\nautoplot(decompose(CO2_Concentration))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly Lags\nBefore performing differencing, we examine the monthly lag plots to determine the length of the seasonality. Based on domain knowledge, we suspect a 12-month lag, as the seasonal pattern recurs annually. The lag plots below confirm this hypothesis. The Month 12 lag plots exhibit an almost perfect y=x line, which is superior to all other lags up to 12 months.\n\ngglagplot(CO2_Concentration, do.lines=FALSE, lags=12)+xlab(\"Xi\")+ylab(\"Yi\")+ggtitle(\"Lag Plot for Monthly CO2_Concentration (1958-2023)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwice Differences (Once Seasonal and Once Standard)\nHaving identified the seasonal lag, we can now use differencing to make the series stationary.

Several other models also have similar AIC and BIC scores, but upon comparing the top models, the (1,1,1)(0,1,1) model is indeed the best one. However, all the options here would provide adequate forecasts for this series, as their performance is very similar.\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\nNow, letâs examine the model diagnostics using standardized residuals.\n\nmodel_output <- capture.output(sarima(CO2_Concentration,1,1,1,0,1,1,12))\n\n\n\n\n\nfit1 <- Arima(CO2_Concentration, order=c(1,1,1), seasonal=c(0,1,1))\nsummary(fit1)\n\nSeries: CO2_Concentration \nARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ma1     sma1\n      0.2164  -0.5793  -0.8629\ns.e.  0.0880   0.0738   0.0184\n\nsigma^2 = 0.09906:  log likelihood = -201.36\nAIC=410.71   AICc=410.77   BIC=429.27\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                     ME      RMSE       MAE         MPE       MAPE      MASE\nTraining set 0.02449999 0.3114867 0.2426831 0.006651617 0.06804522 0.1498467\n                     ACF1\nTraining set -0.003090451\n\n\n\n\nCross-Validation\nTo further validate our SARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) model, we will perform a one-step-ahead cross-validation. In this approach, we iteratively train the model on a portion of the data and then use the model to forecast the next point. We compare this forecast to the actual data and calculate the error. This process is repeated for each data point in the time series, and the overall accuracy of the model is assessed using the mean squared error (MSE) of the one-step-ahead forecasts.\n\n# Cross-validation function\none_step_ahead_cv <- function(data, order, seasonal_order) {\n  n <- length(data)\n  errors <- numeric(n)\n  \n  for (t in (length(seasonal_order) + 2):n) {\n    train_data <- window(data, end = t - 1)\n    test_data <- data[t]\n    if (length(train_data) > 0) {\n      model <- Arima(train_data, order = order, seasonal = seasonal_order)\n      forecasted_value <- forecast(model, h = 1)$mean\n      errors[t] <- (forecasted_value - test_data)^2\n    }\n  }\n  \n  mean(errors, na.rm = TRUE)\n}\n\n\n# Perform cross-validation\n# mse <- one_step_ahead_cv(data = CO2_Concentration, order = c(1, 1, 1), seasonal_order = c(0, 1, 1))\n# mse\n\n\n\nBenchmark Methods and Forecast\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we will compare it to other benchmark methods. The graphs and accuracy tests below demonstrate that the SARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) model significantly outperforms any of the benchmark methods. This gives us confidence in using this model for our forecasts.\n\nautoplot(CO2_Concentration) +\n  autolayer(meanf(CO2_Concentration, h=120),\n            series=\"Mean\", PI=FALSE) +\n  autolayer(naive(CO2_Concentration, h=120),\n            series=\"NaÃ¯ve\", PI=FALSE) +\n  autolayer(snaive(CO2_Concentration, h=120),\n            series=\"SNaÃ¯ve\", PI=FALSE)+\n  autolayer(rwf(CO2_Concentration, h=120, drift=TRUE),\n            series=\"Drift\", PI=FALSE)+\n  autolayer(forecast(fit1,120), \n            series=\"fit\",PI=FALSE) +\n  guides(colour=guide_legend(title=\"Forecast\"))\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can use the SARIMA model to forecast the CO2 concentration over the next 10 years (120 months). The plot below shows the forecast of the ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) model.\n\nfit1 %>% forecast(h=120) %>% autoplot()\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we have successfully built and validated a SARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) model for forecasting future atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. This model effectively accounts for the seasonality present in the CO2 concentration data and outperforms the benchmark methods. Utilizing this model, we can now generate forecasts of CO2 concentrations over the next 10 years and contribute to the understanding of potential future trends in atmospheric CO2 levels."

    "text": "For this section of the EDA, we will be focusing specifically on the Sulfur Hexafluoride (\\(SF_6\\)). This process was repeated for three other atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses as well, but those have been omitted to allow for an in-depth look at Sulfur Hexafluoride.\nSulfur Hexafluoride is an odorless, colorless, and non-toxic gas. It is mostly used as an electrical insulator, as it has a very high dielectric strength. \\(SF_6\\) also has other uses, such as in the production of integrated circuits and flat panel displays, as a tracer gas in leak detection, and as a propellant in aerosol cans. \\(SF_6\\) is a greenhouse gas, and its global warming potential is estimated to be 23,900 times higher than that of carbon dioxide. As such, SF6 is regulated by the Montreal Protocol and the Kyoto Protocol.\nSimilar to the other greenhouse gases, Sulfur Hexafluoride is measured continually at many monitoring stations across the globe. Then, NOAA produces a monthly estimate that accounts for additional factors like weather and available monitoring stations. Sulfur Hexafluoride is measured in parts per trillion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot depicts the alarming rise in the mean monthly concentration of \\(SF_6\\) since 1997, with an increase of nearly threefold in just 25 years. This is a cause of great concern, as \\(SF_6\\) is one of the most potent greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere today. Even though it exists in parts per trillion, this accumulation of \\(SF_6\\) will continue to contribute to the disruption of the planetâs climate in conjunction with other greenhouse gases. Undoubtedly, this is a worrisome trend that must be addressed before it is too late.\nBased on the above plot, we can see a strongly increasing trend of \\(SF_6\\) that has continued uninterrupted since records began. The trend is very consistent and appears to be almost linear, with just a slight exponential increase detectable. There appear to be only a few months in the 25 years where the \\(SF_6\\) concentration was lower than it was in a previous month. Unlike many other greenhouse gases, the concentration of \\(SF_6\\) does not exhibit strong season variation. Gases like \\(CO_2\\) or \\(CH_4\\) which were discussed previously, see significant change depending on the season and location of the monitoring station, however \\(SF_6\\) does not. Other than that, there appear to be no periodic fluctuations and the level of noise appears to be minimal.\nBased only on background knowledge and the above plot, the data appears to be additive rather than multiplicative. One way to know the series is additive is linearity and this plot appears to be nearly linear. Another method is to look at variance, based on this plot, the variance appears to be consistent, pointing to an additive series. These assumptions will be more easy to identify when looking at the decomposition of the series. Examining the individual components of the series can help to confirm whether the data is additive or multiplicative."

    "section": "Decomposition",
    "text": "Decomposition\nAfter decomposing the series, it becomes easier to identify the trend, seasonal, and remainder components. As expected, there is a strong increasing trend that was readily apparent from the initial plot. Additionally, the decomposition process revealed a much subtler seasonal component to this data, which was not easily detected from the initial plot. The seasonal component is highly regular, and appears very similar to the seasonal components of other greenhouse gas concentrations. However, the scale of this seasonal component is miniscule (just 0.01 part per trillion) compared to the increase of the trend, which accounts for an average of 3.5 parts per trillion per year. Similarly, the decomposition reveals that the randomness in the data is very small when compared to the overall trend. This is why the plot appears to be almost linear in nature. It is important to note however, that while randomness may be difficult to detect in the initial plot, it is still an important factor that should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. Using the decomposition, the series is clearly additive. This is based on the linearly increasing trend as well as the seasonality which does not increase in variance as the series increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot clearly illustrates the strong correlation between the monthly lags for the first 6 months. As expected, the values are highly correlated with their preceding values. Since the series lacks any noticeable seasonality, these lags are even more evident. The lag plots demonstrate that the series has a high degree of autocorrelation, which can be diminished with the use of detrending. By utilizing this technique, we can effectively reduce the influence of autocorrelation and gain a better insight into the data."

    "section": "Stationarity",
    "text": "Stationarity\n\nSF6 Concentration (No differencing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plots show the ACF and PACF for the Sulfur Hexafluoride concentration time series. As expected, the ACF plot shows a very high degree of correlation between values, indicating that this series is not stationary. This follows the previous hypothesis that the series was not stationary due to the strong trend and weak seasonality. Since the series is not stationary, there are several options available to make it so. One of these options is differencing, where the values are recaluclated by subtracting each from the previous, providing the difference between each pair of values. Other methods include smoothing the data with a moving average or using a Box-Cox transformation to bring the data into a more stationary state. Ultimately, the goal of these transformations is to make the data stationary so that it can be better modeled and better predictions can be made.\n\n\nSF6 Concentration (1st order difference)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots demonstrate the first-order differencing of the time series. After eliminating most of the trend component, the seasonality is much more visible in the ACF plot. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of the bars in the differenced graph is much smaller than that of the initial ACF plot. A closer analysis of the ACF plot reveals that the seasonality remains relatively strong even after one differencing.The seasonal spikes appear every 12, 24 and 36 months, which is the expected result for a monthly series. Even though there is still an obvious pattern in the ACF plot, it is necessary to differentiate the series once again to make it stationary.\n\n\nSF6 Concentration (2nd order difference)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter taking the difference for the second time, the plots are showing much stronger indications that the series is now stationary. Through it is not perfect, the ACF plot has much less correlation across the range of lag parameters. Although there are still some spikes at 12 and 24 months, taking another difference would not be unreasonable. However, it is important to note that if we over difference the data, it will be much more difficult to detect the signal that we are aiming for. This is evident when we look at the 3rd order difference, where the plot is almost indistinguishable from white noise. As a result, it is critical to be mindful of the order of difference when analyzing time series data.\nThe Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF) is a powerful tool for testing for stationarity in a time series. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, the ADF test should be run on the undifferenced, 1st order, and 2nd order difference of the time series. By doing so, we can compare the results and gain a clearer understanding of stationarity. The results of the ADF test are displayed below.\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration\nDickey-Fuller = -1.0021, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.9371\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration %>% diff()\nDickey-Fuller = -9.9963, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration %>% diff() %>% diff()\nDickey-Fuller = -10.064, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe results of the ADF test indicate that both the 1st and 2nd order differences are stationary, while the undifferenced series is not. This matches my hypothesis, with the exception of the first order difference. Inspection of this ACF plot reveals a clear pattern of correlation at 12 and 24 months. I find it quite puzzling that the ADF test believes that this series is stationary despite the spikes in the ACF plot."

For this example, I will be using the \\(CO_2\\) concentration as it provides a more rich comparison than \\(SF_6\\).\nBelow are four graphs of the \\(CO_2\\) concentration at various levels of smoothing. The first plot is the raw data with no smoothing applied. The seasonal variation is readily apparent in this plot, but that causes the trend to be obscured. One way we can view the trend more easily (other than decomposing) is to use moving average smoothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second graph shows a smoothed moving average of the \\(CO_2\\) concentration with a window that is too small (3 months). Since the concentration follows a 12 month seasonal cycle, the 3 month smoothing only serves to decrease the relative size of the season cycle. While this is a good start to get us to a clear trend line, it is not enough. We will need to apply the smooth moving average with a window that matches the seasonal cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last two graphs are constructed using smooth moving average windows that are multiples of the seasonal cycle length (12 months). Thus, we can no longer see any seasonal variation because each observation now includes data from all parts of the year equally. We could have achieved the same result by decomposing the series, but this is another option if we know the length of a seasonal cycle. Overall, the 12-month and 24 month windows look very similar, especially since this data has a very steady trend."

But the ACF and PACF does not suggest these are good values. Since the auto arima function is sometimes un-trsutworthy, I am still going to go with the (2,1,2) ARIMA as determined by the manual arima model selection.\n\nmodel_output <- capture.output(Arima(cvna, order=c(2,1,2),include.drift = TRUE))\n\nUsing the standardized residuals plots, we can see that the ARIMA model is insufficient to accurately model the financial time series data. Thus, we will need to use the GARCH model on top of the residuals from the ARIMA model. This is a common tactic in financial time series which has a much different pattern than other time series like the greenhouse gases for the remainder of the project. Thus, we will continue modeling with the GARCH model. I choice the GARCH values based on the ACF graph, of the ARIMA mode. As we can see from this chart, we should try all p,q values between 0 and 4."

    "text": "Volatality plot\nFinally, we should also consider the volatility of the data. Volatility is a key feature of financial time series data and will have large effect on the model we end up choosing. Below is the plot of the volatility of the Carvana data. When looking at the volatility plot, we see several large spikes that stick out. The first is in March 2020, which was right at the beginning of COVID, so the volatility is expected. The second large spike occurs at the send of 2022, which is unexpected because the value of the stock is so low at that point. However, it could be thatwith such a low stock price, relative changes have a greater effect. A $10 gain when the stock is at $10 is a 100% increase, but when the stock was at $400 this would be just a 2.5% gain. So it is not crazy that the stock because much more volatile as they value fell off a cliff in 2022.\n\nht = final.fit@h.t #a numeric vector with the conditional variances (h.t = sigma.t^delta)\n\nCVNA=data.frame(CVNA)\nCVNA = data.frame(CVNA,rownames(CVNA))\ncolnames(CVNA)[7] = \"date\"\nCVNA$date=as.Date(CVNA$date,\"%Y-%m-%d\")\nstr(CVNA)\n\n'data.frame':   1511 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ CVNA.Open    : num  13.5 11.6 10.95 10.18 8.59 ...\n $ CVNA.High    : num  13.9 11.7 10.9 10.2 10 ...\n $ CVNA.Low     : num  10.7 10.7 10 8.18 8.14 9.75 10.5 10.4 9.61 10.4 ...\n $ CVNA.Close   : num  11.1 10.77 10.1 8.72 9.98 ...\n $ CVNA.Volume  : num  11297800 1291300 991500 3356500 1840200 ...\n $ CVNA.Adjusted: num  11.1 10.77 10.1 8.72 9.98 ...\n $ date         : Date, format: \"2017-04-28\" \"2017-05-01\" ...\n\ndata= data.frame(ht,CVNA$date)\nggplot(data, aes(y = ht, x = CVNA.date)) + geom_line(col = '#009933') + ylab('Conditional Variance') + xlab('Date')+ggtitle(\"Volatality plot of Carvana Stock\")"

    "text": "Deep learning, which is a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks to simulate human decision-making. These networks are composed of layers of interconnected nodes or âneuronsâ that process input data and generate output. Deep learning and all of its components are incredibly complex, and I cannot exaplin them all here. If you are interested in learning more, IBM provides a great explanation for sata-savvy folks that doesnât get too lost in the weeds.Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, employs artificial neural networks to mimic human decision-making. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes or âneuronsâ that process input data and generate output.\nDeep learning is especially effective with large, unstructured datasets, and although it demands substantial computational power, itâs capable of producing highly accurate models. Thanks to tools like TensorFlow and Keras, deep learning has become more accessible, making it easier to design, train, and deploy models. Deep learning, with its intricate components, is an intricate field, and a comprehensive explanation is beyond this pageâs scope. For those interested in diving deeper, IBM offers an excellent resource that provides a solid understanding without getting overly technical.\nHere are some of the critical elements of deep learning leveraged in the following models include neural networks, weights and biases, activation functions, backpropogation and gradient descent. In the models below, I will make specirfic note of when each of these elements is being utilized.\nNeural Networks: These are inspired by the human brainâs structure, with networks transforming input data through layers of interconnected nodes. Each layer refines the input it receives, gradually building up complex patterns and associations much like our brain does when processing information.\nWeights and Biases: These are parameters that are fine-tuned during the learning process. They determine the significance of inputs and play a pivotal role in the accuracy of the modelâs predictions. Think of them as the factors that determine how much importance should be given to each input when making a prediction.\nActivation Functions: These functions dictate whether a neuron should be activated based on its inputs. Theyâre like the gatekeepers of information that decide whether the input they receive is relevant enough to be passed on to the next layer.\nBackpropagation and Gradient Descent: These are techniques used to adjust weights and biases and minimize the error function. They are the backbone of learning in neural networks, allowing the model to learn from its mistakes and improve over time.\nLeveraging the same univariate time-series data that was utilized in the ARMA/ARIMA models, I successfully implemented and trained three distinct neural network models using Keras. These models included a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. A partition of the data was set aside for training and validation purposes, ensuring an unbiased evaluation of the model performance. Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of overfitting, I incorporated regularization techniques into the modelâs architecture. Consequently, these models now provide a robust framework for making future predictions.\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, SimpleRNN,LSTM,GRU\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras import regularizers\n\nimport plotly.io as pio\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nimport plotly.express as px\npio.renderers.default = \"plotly_mimetype+notebook_connected\""

    "text": "Analysis Questions\n\nHow do the results from the 3 different ANN models compare with each other in terms of accuracy and predictive power\nIn this section, we went on the ardous journey of creating three different Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) - a Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Our objective was to model and predict the atmospheric \\(CO_2\\) concentration over the next decade. The neural nets harness the auto-correlation of the time-series data, refining the observations to align with the 12-month seasonal lag. Essentially, we used data from the same month (e.g., May) across multiple years to predict what the CO2 concentration would look like in the subsequent Mays. This strategy delivered predictions for the atmospheric CO2 levels for the next ten years (Mays), extending until 2033.\nWhen it comes to comparing the performance of these models, itâs a bit of a mixed bag. There was a notable variation across different runs of the code, with either the LSTM or GRU models showing adequate to good performance. Interestingly, the performance of these two models was typically quite close on any given run, while the SRNN consistently trailed behind in terms of results. In the final run of the code, the LSTM model was the best model, with the GRU model close behind, and the SRNN rounding out the three. This performance hierarchy was evident across various evaluation methods, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Loss by Epoch, Parity Plots, and Predictive Results. In the end, the LSTM model emerged as the top model in accurately predicting CO2 concentrations. However, itâs important to remember that this was just the final run. In other iterations, the GRU model demonstrated similar prowess to the LSTM model. Thus, while we can glean some insights from this exercise, the dynamic nature of these models means that the âbestâ model can vary from one run to the next.\n\n\nWhat effect does including regularization have on your results.\nRegularization had a subtle yet noticeable impact on the precision of our modes. As mentioned earlier, the accuracy of different models exhibited considerable variance across different runs, making it a challenge to definitively quantify the influence of regularization. However, generally speaking, the modelsâ performance seemed to dip slightly when regularization was omitted.\nI surmise that the modest effect of regularization can be attributed to the relatively stable scale of the data throughout the time series. In 1958, the atmospheric CO2 concentration was 320 ppm, which rose to 420 ppm by 2023. While this increase is alarmingly significant from an environmental perspective, itâs not such a drastic shift that would significantly amplify the impact of regularization in our models. Over the span of these years, the increase in CO2 concentration amounts to around 35%.\nRegularization often proves to be particularly beneficial in scenarios where the data exhibits substantial scale disparity either within a single dataset or when combined with another dataset. In our case, given the relatively modest scale difference in the CO2 concentration data, the effect of regularization was understandably muted. Nonetheless, its influence, albeit small, contributed to the overall performance increase of our models when using regularization.\n\n\nHow far into the future can the deep learning model accurately predict the future.\nDetermining the precise extent up to which our deep learning models can accurately predict is a challenging task, due in part to the modelâs performance fluctuations across multiple code runs. However, a general observation is that the predictions tend to demonstrate internal consistency - if the model is correctly predicting values up to a certain point, it is likely to continue to do so, but not always. Interestingly, in the case of the LSTM model, the training predictions mirrored the actual values up to a specific point, beyond which it began to underestimate the true values. This underestimation could be attributed to the accelerating rate of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. The model seems to predict a linear continuation of the trend, but the reality has surpassed this linear progression, indicating an accelerating greenhouse gas phenomenon. This acceleration is a grave concern for climate researchers and has been the focus of numerous studies. Therefore, while the predictions demonstrate a consistency with their own trends, it does not necessarily equate to accuracy with the real-world data. The LSTM modelâs performance is indicative of this: minor inaccuracies can accumulate over time, leading to a model that eventually falls short in accurately predicting CO2 concentration towards the end of the test data period. It serves as a reminder that these models must be periodically recalibrated and retrained to adapt to the changing trends in our ever-dynamic climate.\n\n\nHow does your deep learning modeling compare to the traditional single-variable time-series ARMA/ARIMA models from HW-3?\nThe deep learning models, specifically the LSTM and GRU models, significantly outperformed the traditional single-variable time-series ARMA/ARIMA models in predicting atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Initially, I applied the ARMA/ARIMA models to SF6 concentration data, as it did not exhibit seasonality. However, upon revisiting the analysis with CO2 concentration data, the deep learning models demonstrated superior performance.\nThe best CO2 models using the ARMA/ARIMA methods achieved an RMSE of 0.6, while the LSTM model had an RMSE of 0.1 and the GRU model an RMSE of 0.17 for the test data. It is important to note that training ARIMA and deep learning models is a complex and challenging task. It is highly probable that alternative hyperparameter configurations for both methods could yield more accurate predictions. Nonetheless, based on the models we have, it is evident that the deep learning models are substantially more effective in modeling CO2 data and making accurate predictions.\n\n\nCompare your models (use RMSE) and forecasts from these sections with your Deep Learning Models: ARIMA/SARIMA/VAR\nWhen comparing the deep learning models with the SARIMA model, the outcomes echo those of the ARIMA model. The deep learning models, specifically LSTM and GRU, substantially outperform the traditional time series models in modeling and predicting CO2 concentrations. While the SARIMA model did present improved performance over ARIMA, its best RMSE was 0.4, compared to the LSTM model with an RMSE of 0.1, and the GRU model with an RMSE of 0.17 for the test data. Just like with the ARIMA model, the SARIMA modelâs performance may have been hindered by the lack of extensive hyperparameter tuning. Itâs challenging to definitively state which model is superior without further optimization. Nonetheless, the preliminary results indicate that the deep learning models significantly outperform the traditional time series models.\nIn the VAR section, I employed data from four greenhouse gases to construct a multivariate model, aiming to predict future concentrations of all four gases concurrently. I did my best to implement a deep learning model for this task but encountered challenges during the data wrangling stage. As Professor James suggested, the most challenging aspect of the deep learning process (and data science in general) is ensuring the data is appropriately prepared and in a format that TensorFlow likes. I am still working on the multivariate deep learning model and aim to have it ready for the final deliverable. Comparing just the prediciting of the CO2 concentration from the VAR model, we find the same thing as the SARIMA model. The VAR modelâs best RSME for the CO2 is 0.4, which is not even close to the deep learning model."

    "text": "What are Greenhouse Gases?\n\nNature and Composition: Greenhouse gases are atmospheric gases that have the capacity to absorb and emit infrared radiation, contributing to the greenhouse effect. Principal greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (\\(CO_2\\)), methane (\\(CH_4\\)), nitrous oxide (\\(N2_O\\)), and fluorinated gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (\\(SF_6\\)).\nRole in Climate Change: These gases play a critical role in the warming of our planet. They trap heat in the Earthâs atmosphere by preventing it from escaping back into space, causing global temperatures to riseâa phenomenon known as global warming. This is a major driver of the ongoing changes in our global climate.\nSources: Greenhouse gases are released from both natural and human-made sources. Natural sources include decomposition, respiration, ocean release, and volcanic eruptions. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation, deforestation, and industrial processes, significantly contribute to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of several important greenhouse gases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of the (natural) Greenhouse Effect.

    "text": "My Project\nThis semester, my project revolves around analyzing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases over time. Using the tools and techniques Iâve learned in ANLY 560, Iâll be investigating why these concentrations are increasing and how this knowledge can be used to inform policy decisions and contribute to the fight against climate change.\nBased on data from NOAAâs Global Monitoring Lab, in 2020, even with decreased emissions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global average atmospheric carbon dioxide still managed to reach a new record high of 414.72 ppm (parts per million). This increase, the 5th-highest yearly increase since NOAAâs record began in 1958, shows the unabated rise in greenhouse gases. The main reason for the rise in carbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels, which has tripled from an average of 3 billion tons of carbon (11 billion tons of carbon dioxide) per year in the 1960s to 9.5 billion tons of carbon (35 billion tons of carbon dioxide) per year in the 2010s.\nWhile carbon dioxide often takes the spotlight in discussions about greenhouse gases, itâs crucial to remember that itâs not the only player. Methane, for example, which is heavily produced by livestock such as cows, has a larger effect on global warming. As part of this project, I will investigate the correlation between methane and carbon dioxide emissions and aim to raise awareness about the environmental impact of methane."

    "text": "Project Goals and Structure\nThe overarching goal of this project is to utilize time series analysis to dissect the complex patterns in greenhouse gas concentrations over time, and to understand their implications on our climate. To accomplish this, the project will be structured into the following sections:\nData Sources: The foundation of any data analysis project is the data itself. I will begin by sourcing reliable and comprehensive datasets on greenhouse gas concentrations, from reputable sources such as NOAAâs Global Monitoring Lab.\nData Visualization: One of the most effective ways to understand data is to see it. Here, Iâll apply data storytelling techniques to create compelling and intuitive visual representations of the data, which will help us discern patterns, trends, and anomalies.\nExploratory Data Analysis: The initial step in any analysis is to explore the data. This involves checking for missing values, outliers, and making sure the data is clean and ready for further analysis.\nARMA/ARIMA/SARIMA Models: Iâll apply these models to understand the dataâs underlying structure. These models can help identify if thereâs an autoregressive or moving average process occurring, and whether there are seasonal components that need to be accounted for.\nARIMAX/SARIMAX/VAR: These models allow for the inclusion of exogenous variables, which can offer more context to the analysis. This can be particularly useful in understanding how different types of greenhouse gases interact with each other.\nFinancial Time Series Models (ARCH/GARCH): These models, traditionally used in financial forecasting, can be quite effective in modelling volatility, which may be relevant in examining fluctuations in greenhouse gas concentrations.\nDeep Learning for Time Series: Finally, Iâll employ deep learning techniques, which can capture complex patterns and relationships in the data that may be missed by traditional methods.\nThroughout each of these sections, the primary themes will be the impacts and implications of rising greenhouse gas concentrations, the role of human activities in these increases, and the potential avenues for mitigating climate change. By applying these techniques and maintaining these themes, I aim to generate insights that could inform policy decisions and contribute to the global conversation about climate change."
