    "text": "For this section, we will be using an ARIMA model to forecast future atmospheric concentrations of sulfur hexaflouride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plots show the ACF and PACF for the Sulfur Hexafluoride concentration time series. As expected, the ACF plot shows a very high degree of correlation between values, indicating that this series is not stationary. This follows the previous hypothesis that the series was not stationary due to the strong trend and weak seasonality. Since the series is not stationary, there are several options available to make it so. One of these options is differencing, where the values are recaluclated by subtracting each from the previous, providing the difference between each pair of values. Other methods include smoothing the data with a moving average or using a Box-Cox transformation to bring the data into a more stationary state. Ultimately, the goal of these transformations is to make the data stationary so that it can be better modeled and better predictions can be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots demonstrate the first-order differencing of the time series. After eliminating most of the trend component, the seasonality is much more visible in the ACF plot. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of the bars in the differenced graph is much smaller than that of the initial ACF plot. A closer analysis of the ACF plot reveals that the seasonality remains relatively strong even after one differencing.The seasonal spikes appear every 12, 24 and 36 months, which is the expected result for a monthly series. Even though there is still an obvious pattern in the ACF plot, it is necessary to differentiate the series once again to make it stationary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter taking the difference for the second time, the plots are showing much stronger indications that the series is now stationary. Through it is not perfect, the ACF plot has much less correlation across the range of lag parameters. Although there are still some spikes at 12 and 24 months, taking another difference would not be unreasonable. However, it is important to note that if we over difference the data, it will be much more difficult to detect the signal that we are aiming for. This is evident when we look at the 3rd order difference, where the plot is almost indistinguishable from white noise. As a result, it is critical to be mindful of the order of difference when analyzing time series data.\nThe Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF) is a powerful tool for testing for stationarity in a time series. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, the ADF test should be run on the undifferenced, 1st order, and 2nd order difference of the time series. By doing so, we can compare the results and gain a clearer understanding of stationarity. The results of the ADF test are displayed below.\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration\nDickey-Fuller = -1.0021, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.9371\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration %>% diff()\nDickey-Fuller = -9.9963, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration %>% diff() %>% diff()\nDickey-Fuller = -10.064, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe results of the ADF test indicate that both the 1st and 2nd order differences are stationary, while the undifferenced series is not. This matches my hypothesis, with the exception of the first order difference. Inspection of this ACF plot reveals a clear pattern of correlation at 12 and 24 months. I find it quite puzzling that the ADF test believes that this series is stationary despite the spikes in the ACF plot.\n\n\n\nBased on the PACF and ACF plots, I will be modeling the twice-differenced \\(SF_6\\) concentration because I want to ensure that our series is stationary. Based on the ACF and PACF plots of the twice differenced \\(SF_6\\) concentration shown above, I will select 1 and 3 as possible choices for \\(p\\) and 1,2,3, and 4 as possible choices for \\(q\\). Since this data is twice differenced, I will be using a \\(q\\) value of 2.\nAfter running the model, we get the following table of AIC and BIC values based on the model parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\nd\nq\nAIC\nBIC\nAICc\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n0\n-1926.281\n-1922.574\n-1926.268\n\n\n0\n2\n1\n-1972.627\n-1965.213\n-1972.587\n\n\n0\n2\n2\n-2017.168\n-2006.047\n-2017.087\n\n\n0\n2\n3\n-2024.154\n-2009.325\n-2024.019\n\n\n2\n2\n0\n-1943.242\n-1932.120\n-1943.161\n\n\n2\n2\n1\n-2021.723\n-2006.894\n-2021.588\n\n\n2\n2\n2\n-2042.100\n-2023.564\n-2041.896\n\n\n2\n2\n3\n-2026.081\n-2003.839\n-2025.796\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the table, the model with the lowest AIC and BIC scores is the 2,2,2 model. None of the other models are that close to this one in terms of AIC and BIC scores. For the sake of comparison, I will select the worst model of the bunch (0,2,0) to show that even this is very similar to our best model. All of the option here would be adequate for forecasting this series.\n\n\n\nFor a (2,2,2) ARIMA model, the equation is:\n\\[y(t) = c + ϕ(1)*y(t-1) + ϕ(2)*y(t-2) - θ(1)*ε(t-1) - θ(2)*ε(t-2) + ε(t)\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(y(t)\\) is the value of the time series at time t\n\\(c\\) is a constant term (i.e., the mean of the series)\n\\(ϕ(1)\\) and \\(ϕ(2)\\) are the autoregressive coefficients for lags 1 and 2, respectively\n\\(θ(1)\\) and \\(θ(2)\\) are the moving average coefficients for lags 1 and 2, respectively\n\\(ε(t)\\) is white noise (i.e., a random error term) with mean zero and constant variance\n\nNow, lets consider the model diagnostics using standardized residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the most part, the residuals plots looks as we would expect. The residuals have a constant mean and variance, and the lagged p-values for the Ljung-Box statistic are under the 0.05 threshold for all except two of the lags. Something that does still appear is a spike in ACF residuals at lags 12 and 24. This would suggest that the series may not have been adequately stationary prior ro modeling. However, we mentioned this earlier, and it wsa determined that twice-differenced was the proper metric to use, as three-times differences would over difference the data and lose valuable insights.\nNext, we can plot the raw data, our chosen model (2,2,2), and the second model (0,2,0) on the same plot to see how they compare on the training data. As expected, both models are nearly identical to the SF6 data. The lines are directly on top of each other and it is impossible to make out any difference between the models and the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we can compare our ARIMA(2,2,2) model to the auto-arima model. Thankfully, the auto-arima function provides the same model as the one we came to through traditional means. This is validating because there were many choices for p,d, and q, so it is nice to know that the best model was selected in both methods.\n\n\nSeries: SF6_Concentration \nARIMA(2,2,2) \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ar2      ma1     ma2\n      1.2422  -0.5007  -1.8154  0.8326\ns.e.  0.0653   0.0550   0.0495  0.0499\n\nsigma^2 = 6.44e-05:  log likelihood = 1026.05\nAIC=-2042.1   AICc=-2041.9   BIC=-2023.56\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can use the ARIMA model to forecast the SF6 concentration over the next 10 years (120 months). The plot below shows the forecast of the ARIMA(2,2,2) model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the effectiveness of our model, we need to compare to other benchmark methods. Based on the graphs and accuracy tests below, it is clear that the ARIMA(2,2,2) model far outperforms any of the benchmark methods. Thus, we can be confident when using this model going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npred1=forecast(fit1, h=120);\naccuracy(pred1)\n\n                       ME       RMSE         MAE       MPE       MAPE\nTraining set 0.0007896781 0.00794485 0.006303769 0.0115696 0.09585017\n                   MASE        ACF1\nTraining set 0.02238707 -0.04714439\n\n\n\nf1 <- meanf(SF6_Concentration, h=120)\naccuracy(f1)\n\n                       ME     RMSE     MAE       MPE    MAPE     MASE     ACF1\nTraining set 1.282536e-16 2.071243 1.79491 -9.131477 27.7452 6.374407 0.990158\n\n\n\nf2 <- naive(SF6_Concentration, h=120)\naccuracy(f2)\n\n                     ME       RMSE        MAE       MPE     MAPE       MASE\nTraining set 0.02344371 0.02547561 0.02350993 0.3366936 0.338216 0.08349269\n                  ACF1\nTraining set 0.5054292\n\n\n\nf3 <- rwf(SF6_Concentration, h=120)\naccuracy(f3)\n\n                     ME       RMSE        MAE       MPE     MAPE       MASE\nTraining set 0.02344371 0.02547561 0.02350993 0.3366936 0.338216 0.08349269\n                  ACF1\nTraining set 0.5054292"

    "text": "SARIMA: CO2 Concentration\nIn this section, we will use a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast future atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. As the graph below illustrates, the CO2 concentration, though representing a global mean, exhibits a strong seasonal pattern. Therefore, we will employ a SARIMA model for our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCO2 Concentration (No differencing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plots display the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) for the CO2 concentration time series. As anticipated, the ACF plot reveals a strong correlation between values, signifying that this series is non-stationary. This aligns with our previous assumption that the series is non-stationary due to its pronounced seasonality. To achieve stationarity, we will apply differencing.\n\nautoplot(decompose(CO2_Concentration))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly Lags\nBefore performing differencing, we examine the monthly lag plots to determine the length of the seasonality. Based on domain knowledge, we suspect a 12-month lag, as the seasonal pattern recurs annually. The lag plots below confirm this hypothesis. The Month 12 lag plots exhibit an almost perfect y=x line, which is superior to all other lags up to 12 months.\n\ngglagplot(CO2_Concentration, do.lines=FALSE, lags=12)+xlab(\"Xi\")+ylab(\"Yi\")+ggtitle(\"Lag Plot for Monthly CO2_Concentration (1958-2023)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwice Differences (Once Seasonal and Once Standard)\nHaving identified the seasonal lag, we can now use differencing to make the series stationary. We apply one seasonal differencing and one standard differencing to achieve stationarity.

Several other models also have similar AIC and BIC scores, but upon comparing the top models, the (1,1,1)(0,1,1) model is indeed the best one. However, all the options here would provide adequate forecasts for this series, as their performance is very similar.\n\n\nModel Diagnostics\nNow, let’s examine the model diagnostics using standardized residuals.\n\nmodel_output <- capture.output(sarima(CO2_Concentration,1,1,1,0,1,1,12))\n\n\n\n\n\nfit1 <- Arima(CO2_Concentration, order=c(1,1,1), seasonal=c(0,1,1))\nsummary(fit1)\n\nSeries: CO2_Concentration \nARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] \n\nCoefficients:\n         ar1      ma1     sma1\n      0.2164  -0.5793  -0.8629\ns.e.  0.0880   0.0738   0.0184\n\nsigma^2 = 0.09906:  log likelihood = -201.36\nAIC=410.71   AICc=410.77   BIC=429.27\n\nTraining set error measures:\n                     ME      RMSE       MAE         MPE       MAPE      MASE\nTraining set 0.02449999 0.3114867 0.2426831 0.006651617 0.06804522 0.1498467\n                     ACF1\nTraining set -0.003090451\n\n\n\n\nCross-Validation\nTo further validate our SARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) model, we will perform a one-step-ahead cross-validation. In this approach, we iteratively train the model on a portion of the data and then use the model to forecast the next point. We compare this forecast to the actual data and calculate the error. This process is repeated for each data point in the time series, and the overall accuracy of the model is assessed using the mean squared error (MSE) of the one-step-ahead forecasts.\n\n# Cross-validation function\none_step_ahead_cv <- function(data, order, seasonal_order) {\n  n <- length(data)\n  errors <- numeric(n)\n  \n  for (t in (length(seasonal_order) + 2):n) {\n    train_data <- window(data, end = t - 1)\n    test_data <- data[t]\n    if (length(train_data) > 0) {\n      model <- Arima(train_data, order = order, seasonal = seasonal_order)\n      forecasted_value <- forecast(model, h = 1)$mean\n      errors[t] <- (forecasted_value - test_data)^2\n    }\n  }\n  \n  mean(errors, na.rm = TRUE)\n}\n\n\n# Perform cross-validation\n# mse <- one_step_ahead_cv(data = CO2_Concentration, order = c(1, 1, 1), seasonal_order = c(0, 1, 1))\n# mse\n\n\n\nBenchmark Methods and Forecast\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we will compare it to other benchmark methods. The graphs and accuracy tests below demonstrate that the SARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) model significantly outperforms any of the benchmark methods. This gives us confidence in using this model for our forecasts.\n\nautoplot(CO2_Concentration) +\n  autolayer(meanf(CO2_Concentration, h=120),\n            series=\"Mean\", PI=FALSE) +\n  autolayer(naive(CO2_Concentration, h=120),\n            series=\"Naïve\", PI=FALSE) +\n  autolayer(snaive(CO2_Concentration, h=120),\n            series=\"SNaïve\", PI=FALSE)+\n  autolayer(rwf(CO2_Concentration, h=120, drift=TRUE),\n            series=\"Drift\", PI=FALSE)+\n  autolayer(forecast(fit1,120), \n            series=\"fit\",PI=FALSE) +\n  guides(colour=guide_legend(title=\"Forecast\"))\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can use the SARIMA model to forecast the CO2 concentration over the next 10 years (120 months). The plot below shows the forecast of the ARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) model.\n\nfit1 %>% forecast(h=120) %>% autoplot()\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we have successfully built and validated a SARIMA(1,1,1)(0,1,1) model for forecasting future atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. This model effectively accounts for the seasonality present in the CO2 concentration data and outperforms the benchmark methods. Utilizing this model, we can now generate forecasts of CO2 concentrations over the next 10 years and contribute to the understanding of potential future trends in atmospheric CO2 levels."

    "text": "For this section of the EDA, we will be focusing specifically on the Sulfur Hexafluoride (\\(SF_6\\)). This process was repeated for three other atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses as well, but those have been omitted to allow for an in-depth look at Sulfur Hexafluoride.\nSulfur Hexafluoride is an odorless, colorless, and non-toxic gas. It is mostly used as an electrical insulator, as it has a very high dielectric strength. \\(SF_6\\) also has other uses, such as in the production of integrated circuits and flat panel displays, as a tracer gas in leak detection, and as a propellant in aerosol cans. \\(SF_6\\) is a greenhouse gas, and its global warming potential is estimated to be 23,900 times higher than that of carbon dioxide. As such, SF6 is regulated by the Montreal Protocol and the Kyoto Protocol.\nSimilar to the other greenhouse gases, Sulfur Hexafluoride is measured continually at many monitoring stations across the globe. Then, NOAA produces a monthly estimate that accounts for additional factors like weather and available monitoring stations. Sulfur Hexafluoride is measured in parts per trillion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot depicts the alarming rise in the mean monthly concentration of \\(SF_6\\) since 1997, with an increase of nearly threefold in just 25 years. This is a cause of great concern, as \\(SF_6\\) is one of the most potent greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere today. Even though it exists in parts per trillion, this accumulation of \\(SF_6\\) will continue to contribute to the disruption of the planet’s climate in conjunction with other greenhouse gases. Undoubtedly, this is a worrisome trend that must be addressed before it is too late.\nBased on the above plot, we can see a strongly increasing trend of \\(SF_6\\) that has continued uninterrupted since records began. The trend is very consistent and appears to be almost linear, with just a slight exponential increase detectable. There appear to be only a few months in the 25 years where the \\(SF_6\\) concentration was lower than it was in a previous month. Unlike many other greenhouse gases, the concentration of \\(SF_6\\) does not exhibit strong season variation. Gases like \\(CO_2\\) or \\(CH_4\\) which were discussed previously, see significant change depending on the season and location of the monitoring station, however \\(SF_6\\) does not. Other than that, there appear to be no periodic fluctuations and the level of noise appears to be minimal.\nBased only on background knowledge and the above plot, the data appears to be additive rather than multiplicative. One way to know the series is additive is linearity and this plot appears to be nearly linear. Another method is to look at variance, based on this plot, the variance appears to be consistent, pointing to an additive series. These assumptions will be more easy to identify when looking at the decomposition of the series. Examining the individual components of the series can help to confirm whether the data is additive or multiplicative."

    "text": "Decomposition\nAfter decomposing the series, it becomes easier to identify the trend, seasonal, and remainder components. As expected, there is a strong increasing trend that was readily apparent from the initial plot. Additionally, the decomposition process revealed a much subtler seasonal component to this data, which was not easily detected from the initial plot. The seasonal component is highly regular, and appears very similar to the seasonal components of other greenhouse gas concentrations. However, the scale of this seasonal component is miniscule (just 0.01 part per trillion) compared to the increase of the trend, which accounts for an average of 3.5 parts per trillion per year. Similarly, the decomposition reveals that the randomness in the data is very small when compared to the overall trend. This is why the plot appears to be almost linear in nature. It is important to note however, that while randomness may be difficult to detect in the initial plot, it is still an important factor that should be taken into consideration when analyzing the data. Using the decomposition, the series is clearly additive. This is based on the linearly increasing trend as well as the seasonality which does not increase in variance as the series increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot clearly illustrates the strong correlation between the monthly lags for the first 6 months. As expected, the values are highly correlated with their preceding values. Since the series lacks any noticeable seasonality, these lags are even more evident. The lag plots demonstrate that the series has a high degree of autocorrelation, which can be diminished with the use of detrending. By utilizing this technique, we can effectively reduce the influence of autocorrelation and gain a better insight into the data."

    "section": "Stationarity",
    "text": "Stationarity\n\nSF6 Concentration (No differencing)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plots show the ACF and PACF for the Sulfur Hexafluoride concentration time series. As expected, the ACF plot shows a very high degree of correlation between values, indicating that this series is not stationary. This follows the previous hypothesis that the series was not stationary due to the strong trend and weak seasonality. Since the series is not stationary, there are several options available to make it so. One of these options is differencing, where the values are recaluclated by subtracting each from the previous, providing the difference between each pair of values. Other methods include smoothing the data with a moving average or using a Box-Cox transformation to bring the data into a more stationary state. Ultimately, the goal of these transformations is to make the data stationary so that it can be better modeled and better predictions can be made.\n\n\nSF6 Concentration (1st order difference)\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plots demonstrate the first-order differencing of the time series. After eliminating most of the trend component, the seasonality is much more visible in the ACF plot. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of the bars in the differenced graph is much smaller than that of the initial ACF plot. A closer analysis of the ACF plot reveals that the seasonality remains relatively strong even after one differencing.The seasonal spikes appear every 12, 24 and 36 months, which is the expected result for a monthly series. Even though there is still an obvious pattern in the ACF plot, it is necessary to differentiate the series once again to make it stationary.\n\n\nSF6 Concentration (2nd order difference)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter taking the difference for the second time, the plots are showing much stronger indications that the series is now stationary. Through it is not perfect, the ACF plot has much less correlation across the range of lag parameters. Although there are still some spikes at 12 and 24 months, taking another difference would not be unreasonable. However, it is important to note that if we over difference the data, it will be much more difficult to detect the signal that we are aiming for. This is evident when we look at the 3rd order difference, where the plot is almost indistinguishable from white noise. As a result, it is critical to be mindful of the order of difference when analyzing time series data.\nThe Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF) is a powerful tool for testing for stationarity in a time series. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, the ADF test should be run on the undifferenced, 1st order, and 2nd order difference of the time series. By doing so, we can compare the results and gain a clearer understanding of stationarity. The results of the ADF test are displayed below.\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration\nDickey-Fuller = -1.0021, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.9371\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration %>% diff()\nDickey-Fuller = -9.9963, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  SF6_Concentration %>% diff() %>% diff()\nDickey-Fuller = -10.064, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe results of the ADF test indicate that both the 1st and 2nd order differences are stationary, while the undifferenced series is not. This matches my hypothesis, with the exception of the first order difference. Inspection of this ACF plot reveals a clear pattern of correlation at 12 and 24 months. I find it quite puzzling that the ADF test believes that this series is stationary despite the spikes in the ACF plot."

For this example, I will be using the \\(CO_2\\) concentration as it provides a more rich comparison than \\(SF_6\\).\nBelow are four graphs of the \\(CO_2\\) concentration at various levels of smoothing. The first plot is the raw data with no smoothing applied. The seasonal variation is readily apparent in this plot, but that causes the trend to be obscured. One way we can view the trend more easily (other than decomposing) is to use moving average smoothing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second graph shows a smoothed moving average of the \\(CO_2\\) concentration with a window that is too small (3 months). Since the concentration follows a 12 month seasonal cycle, the 3 month smoothing only serves to decrease the relative size of the season cycle. While this is a good start to get us to a clear trend line, it is not enough. We will need to apply the smooth moving average with a window that matches the seasonal cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last two graphs are constructed using smooth moving average windows that are multiples of the seasonal cycle length (12 months). Thus, we can no longer see any seasonal variation because each observation now includes data from all parts of the year equally. We could have achieved the same result by decomposing the series, but this is another option if we know the length of a seasonal cycle. Overall, the 12-month and 24 month windows look very similar, especially since this data has a very steady trend."

Through time series analysis, I aim to gain a better understanding of why these concentrations are increasing and how this information can be used to inform policy decisions.\nBased on analysis from NOAA’s Global Monitoring Lab, in 2020, despite the decrease emissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global average atmospheric carbon dioxide reached a new record high of 414.72 ppm (parts per million) This represents an increase of 2.58 ppm over the previous year, and is the 5th-highest yearly increase since NOAA’s record began in 1958. The main reason for the rise in carbon dioxide is burning fossil fuels, which has tripled from an average of 3 billion tons of carbon (11 billion tons of carbon dioxide) per year in the 1960s to 9.5 billion tons of carbon (35 billion tons of carbon dioxide) per year in the 2010s.\nCarbon dioxide has been garnering the most attention in regards to greenhouse gases, however, it is not the most damaging of them. Methane, which is heavily produced by livestock such as cows, has a larger effect on global warming. With this project, I intend to investigate the correlation between methane and carbon dioxide and spread awareness of methane’s environmental impact.\n\nQuestions\n\nIs there a greater correlation between carbon-based greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane) versus non-carbon based greenhouse gases (nitrous oxide and sulfur hexafluoride)?\nTo what degree is the trend of the four greenhouse gas concentrations correlated?\nTo what degree is the seasonality of the four greenhouse gas concentrations correlated?\nAre any of the greenhouse gas concentrations strongly or weakly stationary?\nWhat is the daily predictive accuracy of the four greenhouse gases?\nAre there significant differences in seasonal trends between the northern and southern hemispheres, or at the equator?\nIs there a correlation between the proximity of a station to large greenhouse gas emitters and the magnitude of seasonal variation in concentrations?\nHow do the temporal components of the data vary by station or region?\nTo what extent are greenhouse gas concentrations affected by meteorological conditions, specifically temperature?\nDo the data indicate any potential avenues of mitigation of climate change?"
